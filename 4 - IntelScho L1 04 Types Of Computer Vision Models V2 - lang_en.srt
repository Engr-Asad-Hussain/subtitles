1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,030
Before we get too deep into pre-train models,

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,270
let's look at the types of computer vision models there are.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,090
We will mainly focus on classification,

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,030
detection, and segmentation here.

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:17,355
Now, there are other various types or sub-types here as well.

6
00:00:17,355 --> 00:00:20,190
Pose estimation or text recognition,

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,840
for example, might not fit neatly into these categories.

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,775
Deep learning also has generation of content with GANs as well,

9
00:00:29,775 --> 00:00:32,805
although that's not really applicable here.

10
00:00:32,805 --> 00:00:35,760
First, let us look at classification.

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,210
Classification determines a given class that

12
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,765
an image or an object in an image belongs to.

13
00:00:42,765 --> 00:00:48,180
This can scale from a simple yes/no answer such as hotdog versus

14
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,815
not hotdog up to potentially thousands of classes like a type of animal.

15
00:00:53,815 --> 00:01:01,160
The ImageNet dataset often used to pre-train neural networks contains 20,000 classes.

16
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:06,425
The most well-known competition with ImageNet uses 1,000 of these classes,

17
00:01:06,425 --> 00:01:10,645
90 of which are just for different dog breeds.

18
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:13,340
These usually have some probability by

19
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,660
class so that the highest probability is the determined class,

20
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:22,300
but you can also see the top five predictions, for example.

21
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,070
In detection, this gets used in

22
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:28,520
determining the objects appear at different places in an image.

23
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,200
At its most basic,

24
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,980
this could be similar to the yes/no classification of whether an object appears at all.

25
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,565
Typically, it's more advanced than this,

26
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:43,540
both detecting an object appears as well as where an image it appears.

27
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,850
Oftentimes, this will draw bounding boxes around

28
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:51,140
the detected objects so the output may be related to x,

29
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,940
y coordinates, as well as height and width of the object.

30
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,670
Usually, there's some form of classification built on,

31
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,245
depending on the network,

32
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:04,270
so that these bounding boxes also note which class they are.

33
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,745
These bounding boxes also have a confidence threshold,

34
00:02:07,745 --> 00:02:11,000
so you can throw out low confidence predictions.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,430
Next up is segmentation.

36
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:18,925
Segmentation classify sections of an image by classifying each and every pixel.

37
00:02:18,925 --> 00:02:21,290
Once again, this can be simple,

38
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:25,595
like road versus not road or there may be tens of classes,

39
00:02:25,595 --> 00:02:27,830
such as road, lay line,

40
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,235
grass, tree, sky, pedestrian.

41
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:36,730
You get it. Each and every pixel in the image will be put into a class,

42
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:41,360
although light classification, they may have different probabilities by pixel.

43
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,395
Now, these are often post-processed in some way to avoid phantom classes here and there.

44
00:02:47,395 --> 00:02:50,805
There's also a subset of segmentation they consider,

45
00:02:50,805 --> 00:02:54,380
semantic segmentation versus instance segmentation.

46
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:59,630
Semantic segmentation just focuses on classifying every pixel into a given class.

47
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:04,600
So two objects of the same class in an image are looked at the same.

48
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,970
On the other hand, instance segmentation actually

49
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,795
determines objects of the same class to be separate instances.

50
00:03:11,795 --> 00:03:15,940
So two bikes could be separately tracked through a video.

51
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,040
We've looked at different types of computer vision models.

52
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,150
Now, let's look at some example architectures for computer vision models.
